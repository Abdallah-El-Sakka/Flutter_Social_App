# Flutter Social App

I created this project using Flutter which depends on the dart language.
I also used Firebase to authenticate users, save users' data, and send cloud messaging.

The app includes:
- posts with reactions from users.
- messenger chat.
- profile viewer and the access to edit it.
- can view any user's profile

hope it will be useful :)
